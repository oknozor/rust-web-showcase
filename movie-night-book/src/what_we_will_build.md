# (WIP) What we will build


Before we dive into the code let's take a moment to review the app specification. 

## Domain 

- The application we will build is a kind of meetup/social network for cinephils

- The idea is to plan a movie night with a group of friends, every attendee will secretly pick a movie and one among them will be randomly picked by the backend at the last moment. 

- In order to keep the suspens for as long as possible, user get notified about who have been choosed, not which movie.

- After that the group watch the choosen movie and enjoy.

- Users can rate the movie they watched already.

- Users can then plan a new movie night.

- Users that have already been choosen are not allowed to pick a new moovie until every one has been choosen ones. 

- Users can access their movie night history and see which movies have already been choosen and by who. 

- Users can post comments on their group lobby.

- Users can bookmark movies. 

- Users can search movies. 

- When all users in a group have been choosen ones, everyone on the group get to choose a new movie for the next event.
